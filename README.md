A project to learn different Web Animations

## 1 Alex Tkachev's page transition

### Things I learned

- I learned how to use motion+ library with react
- I understood the purpose of variants
- I like the use of factory function 'animate' to atttach the animation object to the elements

### Resources Used

- For this animation I did Alex's exit animation
- This is done by following Oliver Larose tutorial

## 2 K72 page transition

- There are columns that go down or up in a staggered fashion like stairs

- This animatio was much simpler
